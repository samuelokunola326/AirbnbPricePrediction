# AirbnbPricePrediction

## Overview 
This app uses machine learning models to predict NYC Airbnb prices and understand some of the key driving factors behind the pricing of any given listing.

 ###### Data Storage
<!-- MongoDB was used to store the results from the testing of our models and to connect the data on the backend of our web application. -->

 ###### Hosting Application
The app uses html flask templates on the back end to render data via web browser and enable functionality and then deploy to Heroku for public access.

 ###### Preprocessing/Data Cleaning
The team used Jupyter Notebook to complete all preprocessing and data cleaning that was needed before spliting, training and testing each model.

Model Testing/Selection
Our group will train and test 3 different model types to predict the price of Airbnb listings in the New York area. We will compare the accuracy of the model against each other and use the model that produces the highest accuracy score as our final/primary model.

Data Visualization
Our team will also use Tableau to visualize our findings during the exploration of the model testing/selection process.
