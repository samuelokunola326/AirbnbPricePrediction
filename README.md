# AirbnbPricePrediction

The Problem
Using machine learning models to predict NYC Airbnb price and understanding some of the key driving factors behind the pricing of any given listing.

Data Storage
Our team will use MongoDB to store the results from the testing of our models and to connect the data on the backend of our web application.

Hosting Application
Our team will be utilizing flask app and html to host data and will deploy to Heroku.

Preprocessing/Data Cleaning
Our group will work in Jupyter Notebook to complete any preprocessing and data cleaning that is needed before training and testing each model.

Model Testing/Selection
Our group will train and test 3 different model types to predict the price of Airbnb listings in the New York area. We will compare the accuracy of the model against each other and use the model that produces the highest accuracy score as our final/primary model.

Data Visualization
Our team will also use Tableau to visualize our findings during the exploration of the model testing/selection process.
